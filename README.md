# Project 05: Processing Video Game Data using the Bridges API

**Student name:**

## Objectives

1. Practice using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) vector class.
2. Practice storing and analyzing large datasets retrieved from external APIs.
3. Practice implementing search algorithms using the `find()` function.
4. Practice sorting data using STL sorting functions.
5. Practice efficient parameter passing (pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value).
6. Practice creating custom data processing and analysis functions.
7. Gain experience with the Bridges Library for data visualization.

## Description

In this project, you will use the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) vector class to store and analyze video game data retrieved using the Bridges Library. You will process games to discover all unique genres, allow users to select genres and view games, and implement your own data analysis feature.
